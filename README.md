# ForSyDe Workshop
## Overview
This page contains course material for the participants of a ForSyDe workshop, which so far is intended to be given as an interactive hands-on-tutorial. Currently the content of the web page is minor - it mainly hosts the source code used in the workshop.

The workshop will use the ForSyDe-Shallow library to introduce the ForSyDe modelling concepts. The API of ForSyDe-Shallow is documented and available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/forsyde-shallow/).

<ins>Prerequisites:</ins> Course participants should have [a working Haskell installation](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/) on their computer. 

In its present form, the workshop covers the following parts.

- Overview: ForSyDe Modelling Environment
- Introduction: Synchronous Model of Computation
- Introduction: Adaptive Systems
- Introduction: Data-Parallelism with Skeletons

## Further development of workshop content
Given time and interest of potential ForSyDe users, the idea is to further develop this workshop repository. But promises cannot be given...
